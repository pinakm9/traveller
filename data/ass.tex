Assignment 2

Implement the travelling salesman problem using genetic algorithms. Use
mutation probability of 0.01 and crossover probability of 0.95 . Let the
population size be 50. Mutation to be used is swapping two elements. Use all 
the different methods of crossover as taught in the class, and find the best 
crossover. Compare the results obtained by using the different crossovers. You 
can also compare results obtained without elitism and with elitism. Give the 
results for the 100 city data given in the file City_Coordinates.txt. This gives
X and Y coordinates for 100 cities. Do not make the distance
between cities an integer. Use real values. The comparison should include the tour 
length and also the number of iterations required to get the solution. Use C/C++
or Java or Python. The genetic algorithm code should be written from scratch. 
Don't use readymade code.

Submit to susheela@iisc.ac.in as ass2.tar.gz . This should contain source code,
and your results either as table or graphs etc. The way you present the
results is left to you. Submit by 16th November 2018 by 10 AM.
